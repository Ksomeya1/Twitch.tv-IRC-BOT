# Twitch.tv-IRC-BOT
IRC Chat bot similar to NightBot or HnlBot
This is a custom twitch chat IRC BOT using TMI.js and twitch command API with the help of Cheerio.js' framework

In order to make the bot work properly you must authenticate with Twitch by getting your Oauth token key from TMI's website. 

1) You can copy git clone these files and everything will work besides the Oauth token which is unique to the websites session.

2) After getting your unique Oauth replace the one within the folde.

3) Replace your totesmahdotes channel with your own channel if you'd like to make your own unique bot name

4) Grant moderator access to your bot.

5) Add more phrases or parse more words by replacing the regular expression with the parenthesis. 

6) You call more methods by checking out the TMI documentation and using their library. 

7) Enjoy and have a clean chat room.
